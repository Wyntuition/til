# SIL (Soon I'll Learn)

### .NET Core 
- Key points in the differences b/t .NET target frameworks (.NET Standard vs PCL, targeting multiple framework implications)
- Elastic search implementation 
- vim workflow and tools 

### DevOps 
- Swarm w/ZooKeeper/etc: Swarm is fairly straightforward: each host runs a Swarm agent and one host runs a Swarm manager (on small test clusters this host may also run an agent). The manager is responsible for the orchestration and scheduling of containers on the hosts. Swarm can be run in a high-availability mode where one of etcd, Consul or ZooKeeper is used to handle fail-over to a back-up manager
    - VS App CoreOS (for containers) + Kubernetes + rkt + fleet (like Techtonic) 

### Python 

- Flask app to explore python architecture (thinner than Django, so more interactive with Python) using PyCharm Community vs Pro to see how they compare to the VS and Atom/Sublime/Code approaches.
